## 📏 TLA+ Spec Refinement

### 🔍 What is Refinement?

**Refinement** means that a **lower-level (implementation) specification** correctly implements the behavior of a **higher-level (abstract) specification**. In TLA+, this allows you to write a simple spec describing _what_ a system should do, and a more detailed one describing _how_ it does it—and then prove they behave consistently. In short: **Implementation Spec** refines **High-Level Spec** if every behavior of the implementation is _allowed_ by the high-level spec.
Refinement is semantic: it’s about the meaning of the specs (their behaviors), not about syntax. Specs don’t have to share variables or modules.

### ✅ How to Check Refinement with TLC

**General Process:**

1. Write the missing specification: either the abstract (high-level) or the concrete (implementation-level) specification, depending on which one already exists. Typically, one of the two is already defined and remains unchanged.
2. **Instantiate the abstract specification** in the concrete one using the `INSTANCE` statement.
3. **Define a refinement mapping** with the `WITH` clause, relating implementation variables to abstract variables, if needed.
4. **Verify refinement using TLC** by ensuring that the abstract specification is a `PROPERTY` of the concrete specification.

### 🧪 Example

Assume you have a high-level spec in a module named `HighLevel`:

```tla
------------------- MODULE HighLevel -------------------
VARIABLE counter

Init == counter = 0
Next == counter' = counter + 1

Spec == Init /\ [][Next]_counter
========================================================
```

#### Case 1: Refinement mapping with `WITH` (symbols differ)

When the implementation uses different variable names (here `x` and `y` instead of `counter`), you need an explicit refinement mapping:

```tla
------------------- MODULE Impl -------------------
EXTENDS Naturals

VARIABLE x, y

Init == x = 0 /\ y = 0
Next == \/ x' = x + 1 /\ y' = y
        \/ x' = x /\ y' = y + 1

Spec == Init /\ [][Next]_<<x, y>>

----

High == INSTANCE HighLevel WITH counter <- x
Refinement == High!Spec
====================================================
```

Here, `counter <- x` maps the high-level variable `counter` to the low-level variable `x`. The implementation can freely change low-level state variables (like incrementing `y`) that don't affect the abstract state.

#### Case 2: Using state functions in mappings

The refinement mapping isn't limited to variables—it can use any **state function**. For example, you could map `counter` to the sum of both variables:

```tla
High == INSTANCE HighLevel WITH counter <- x + y
```

This would check if the implementation where `counter` equals `x + y` refines the high-level spec.

#### Case 3: No `WITH` needed (symbols match)

If the implementation defines a symbol with the same name as in the high-level spec, the mapping is implicit and `WITH` is not required (though you can still use it explicitly if desired). For example, you can define `counter` as a state function:

```tla
------------------- MODULE ImplWithDefinition -------------------
EXTENDS Naturals

VARIABLE x, y

counter == x + y  \* Define counter as a state function

Init == x = 0 /\ y = 0
Next == \/ x' = x + 1 /\ y' = y
        \/ x' = x /\ y' = y + 1

Spec == Init /\ [][Next]_<<x, y>>

----

High == INSTANCE HighLevel  \* No WITH needed!
Refinement == High!Spec
============================================================
```

Since the implementation defines `counter` (as a state function), no explicit `WITH` mapping is required.

#### Checking refinement with TLC

In your TLC config file for the implementation module, set:

```cfg
SPECIFICATION Spec
PROPERTY Refinement
```

This checks: "Does my implementation spec (`Spec`) refine the abstract spec (`High!Spec`)?"

### 🧠 Advanced Notes

TLA+ refinement is **stuttering insensitive**. That means if your implementation does "extra steps" such as `x' = x /\ y' = y + 1` that don’t change the abstract state (the variable `counter` above), it's still a valid refinement—as long as the visible behavior aligns.

> 🧠 Think of it as: the abstract spec doesn’t care _how_ the result was achieved, as long as the _resulting behavior_ is the same.
